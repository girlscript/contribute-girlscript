## Introduction
GirlScript is a project being developed under the [Mozilla Leadership Training Program, 2017](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/mozilla-open-leadership-training-series) and mentored by [Kristie Whitaker.](https://github.com/KirstieJane)

The project is designed to help and guide people who want to improve their technical skills. As the name indicates, it helps women to learn and improve their technical skiltells them about different opportunities available for them in the world outside. Through this project, we want to develop an online platform for GirlScript, our offline trainings have already begun in 3 cities of India.

## Why does this project exist?
- Lack of diversity in field of tech
- Lack of skills in people specially women
- Lack of awareness about different opportunities available
- To reduce noise presence on the internet and help those who really want to learn and get inspired by others

## What we plan to do about it?
- To conduct offline workshops by establishing GirlScript chapters in different cities of India
- To create an online platform for helping international students providing different courses and a chatroom 
- Send newsletter to all the subscribed users to make them aware about different opportunities
- Create a technical blog section and get inspired section for interviews

## How are we doing it?
As we have started our offline events successfully but we want to grow and create an impact which would only be possible by creating a website. A website that can have home, about us, get inspired and a blog page. Also, there should be a sign up option before we allow users to gain access to free course content section on the website. Also, guidlines for being a volunteer.
- Have a databse of people who have already registered
- Subscribe option for newsletters and a map showing our current location of 3 cities in which are already working.
- A blog page and a get inspired page for writing blogs and interviews respectively.
- Have a chatroom for any queries.
If you don't wish to help in developing a website and want to help in some other way then please donate some technical course contents for the website.
- The course contents must be self-created or if you have taken help from somewhere then kindly mention it.
- We will write your name and link to any social media platforms if you contribute for our project.
- The course can be anything which a begineer in tech must start from. For exaample, you can create a course on HTML5, CSS3, Python or anything which you feel people should know about.
- It can be a brief course like a summary, highlighting the main points. Also, the language should be easy to understand.
Also, if you have any ideas likes games abd activities that we should include in our offline workshops then please let us know.
- Theme or activity must be based on a technical topic and must teach anything related to it. For example, making use of HTML boxes for learning HTML.
